//hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
//non-linear data structure
//in linear data structure, the time req to search is proportional to the size of the data set
//trees allow quicker and easier access to the data bc they are non-linear
//a tree will not contain any loops of cycles
//used when hierarchical rep is needed
//    file systems or directory structures
//    family tree
//    any organisation tree
//    DOM
//    chat bots
//    abstract syntax trees
